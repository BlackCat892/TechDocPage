			<h1>Intro</h1>
			<p>This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is not intended as a tutorial. Every
				Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and standard modules. These are documented in The
				Python Standard Library. A few built-in modules are mentioned when they interact in a significant way
				with the language definition. Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as
				documented in this manual, or introduces specific information beyond what’s covered in the standard
				Python documentation. Please refer to the implementation-specific documentation to determine what else
				you need to know about the specific implementation you’re using.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>CPython</h3>
				<p>This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in C. New language
					features generally appear here first.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Jython</h3>
				<p>Python implemented in Java. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java
					applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is also often
					used to create tests for Java libraries. More information can be found at the Jython website.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Python for .NET</h3>
				<p>This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed .NET application and
					makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian Lloyd. For more information, see the Python
					for .NET home page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>IronPython</h3>
				<p>An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation that
					generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by Jim Hugunin,
					the original creator of Jython. For more information, see the IronPython website.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>PyPy</h3>
				<p> An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports several advanced features not
					found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals
					of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to
					modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). Additional information is available on the
					PyPy project’s home page.

			<p>Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or
				Java.

				Some of Python's notable features:

				Uses an elegant syntax, making the programs you write easier to read.
				Is an easy-to-use language that makes it simple to get your program working. This makes Python ideal for
				prototype development and other ad-hoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.
				Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to
				web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.
				Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled
				development environment called IDLE.
			</p>
			<p>Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.
				Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.

				Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Unix, with unofficial builds also available for
				Android and iOS.

				Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in
				your application. Python can also be freely modified and re-distributed because while the language is
				copyrighted it's available under an open-source license.</p>

		<section class="main-section" id="Data_model">
			<p>Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by
				relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program
				computer,” code is also represented by objects.)

				Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s identity never changes once it has been
				created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The ‘is’ operator compares the identity
				of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.</p>
			<p>An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”) and
				also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The type() function returns an object’s type
				(which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type is also unchangeable. 1

				The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; objects
				whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable. (The value of an immutable
				container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is
				changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it
				contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value,
				it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers, strings and
				tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable.

				Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be
				garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether —
				it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no objects
				are collected that are still reachable.</p>

				object.__le__(self, other)
				object.__eq__(self, other)
				object.__ne__(self, other)
				object.__gt__(self, other)
				object.__ge__(self, other)</code>

		<section class="main-section" id="Importing">
			<p>Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it. The
				import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only way.
				Functions such as importlib.import_module() and built-in __import__() can also be used to invoke the
				import machinery.

				The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the
				results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is
				defined as a call to the __import__() function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of
				__import__() is used to perform the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import
				statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.

				A direct call to __import__() performs only the module search and, if found, the module creation
				operation. While certain side-effects may occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the
				updating of various caches (including sys.modules), only the import statement performs a name binding
				operation.</p>
			<p>When an import statement is executed, the standard builtin __import__() function is called. Other
				mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as importlib.import_module()) may choose to bypass
				__import__() and use their own solutions to implement import semantics.

				When a module is first imported, Python searches for the module and if found, it creates a module object
				1, initializing it. If the named module cannot be found, a ModuleNotFoundError is raised. Python
				implements various strategies to search for the named module when the import machinery is invoked. These
				strategies can be modified and extended by using various hooks described in the sections below.

				Changed in version 3.3: The import system has been updated to fully implement the second phase of PEP
				302. There is no longer any implicit import machinery - the full import system is exposed through
				sys.meta_path. In addition, native namespace package support has been implemented (see PEP 420).

			<p>This chapter explains the meaning of the elements of expressions in Python.</p>
			<p>In this and the following chapters, extended BNF notation will be used to describe syntax, not lexical
				analysis. When (one alternative of) a syntax rule has the form and no semantics are given, the semantics
				of this form of name are the same as for othername.</p>
